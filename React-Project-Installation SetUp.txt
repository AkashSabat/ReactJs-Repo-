Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

 After making changes build your project
	npm run build 
	
 You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build
